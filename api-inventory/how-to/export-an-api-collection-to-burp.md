# Export an API Collection to Burp

## Setup Burp Integration using

In the demonstration below, we have first bridged the connection between our Akto account and the Burp Suite account before we can start populating the API traffic in our API inventory. This integration begins by downloading the executable “**`Jar file`**” provided in the Akto account. Later on, this file is uploaded to the Burp Suite account to initiate the installation of the Akto extension.

Once the extension was successfully installed in the Burp Suite account, we navigated back to Akto to copy the **`AKTO ID`** & **`AKTO TOKEN`** and paste the values in the relevant fields provided under the Akto extension tab in Burp Suite.

Moving forward, we launched the native browser of Burp Suite and recorded an interaction (refreshing the web page - https://juiceshop.akto.io in this case). This activity triggered the APIs on the web page and populated the associated traffic data in our Akto account.
