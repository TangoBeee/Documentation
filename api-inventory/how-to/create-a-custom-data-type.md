## Add Data Type Condition

While creating custom data types within Akto, it's essential to add specific data type conditions to ensure the integrity and validity of the data stored in those types. The specific conditions you set are dependent on the needs of your application. There are two data type conditions that you can set when creating custom data types: **`Key condition`** and **`Value condition`**.
