# Delete an API Collection

Akto allows you to remove your API collections whenever you want. Once deleted, a confirmation message will appear. You can also remove all your API collections at once by selecting them all. This is useful when you need to delete old or unused collections, for testing, development, security and compliance, etc.

In the demonstration below, the steps are illustrated for how to delete an API collection within Akto.

Go to **API Inventory> API Collection**. Check the **API Collection** and click on **Remove Collection**.
