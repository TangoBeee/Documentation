# Data Types

## What is Data Type?

**`Data Type`** refers to the specific formats or structures used to represent different types of data in requests and responses. Simply put, data types are like labels that tell you what kind of information you're dealing with in APIs. For example:

* EMAIL
* JWT
* ADDRESS
* IP\_ADDRESS
* PHONE\_NUMBER

## Customize Data Type

* Custom data types let you match the format to your specific needs, ensuring your data is a perfect fit. For example, you can design a data type like **`Order`** or **`Customer`** to match the unique structure of your application's data.
* Custom data types enhance communication between different parts of your system by defining exactly what kind of information is expected, reducing the chance of errors or misinterpretation.
* By creating custom data types, you have the flexibility to adapt your API to evolving business requirements. This ensures that your application can efficiently handle new types of data without compromising existing functionality.
