# Alerts

## What is Webhook Alert?

You can configure and enable webhook alerts in Akto to receive real-time notifications whenever the system detects the occurrence of specific events like identification of a new sensitive endpoint in your API collection.

You can select the events in Akto for which you want the webhook alerts to be triggered and have them received in your Slack channel, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Datadog, Splunk, JIRA, Trello, and many more.

## Data inside Webhook Alert

Keeping track of new endpoints and sensitive parameters can be a burdensome and hefty process. However, using Akto webhooks can allow your team to automate this process and stay updated with real-time notifications for all or any of the following events in your API collection:

* New endpoint
* New endpoint count
* New sensitive endpoint
* New sensitive endpoint count
* New sensitive parameter count
* New parameter count
