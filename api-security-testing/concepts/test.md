# Test

Akto comes with over 200+ pre-built tests to find vulnerabilities like Broken Authentication, Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and the rest of OWASP's Top 10 and HackerOne Top 10 in APIs. You can also create custom tests that match your API's unique needs. This way, you can ensure a detailed and targeted security check that perfectly aligns with your API's structure and requirements.

You can also schedule your test to run at times that best fit your workflow, ensuring that your API security is checked regularly without disrupting your normal operations.

For more information on how to schedule the test, please refer to the documentation- [**Schedule Test**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QWO4hfRT95Qy4dcO6fin/s/Rc4KTKGprZI2sPWKoaLe/\~/changes/421/api-security-testing/how-to/schedule-tests). You can also [create your custom tests](broken-reference) and [run tests in CI/CD](broken-reference) for continuous testing.&#x20;
